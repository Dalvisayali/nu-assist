UHCS Policy on Sick Notes,UHCS does not provide sick notes. To learn more visit our page regarding sick notes.  University policy indicates that instructors are not allowed to ask a student for medical proof/confirmation of illness or appointment. Please review the university policy in the catalog. 
Psychopharmacology Services,
Things to Consider When Making a Psychopharmacology Appointment ,"Should you chose to begin taking medication after you evaluation, you will be expected to attend follow-up appointments with your prescriber, scheduled according to your treatment needs. Medication refills are generally prescribed in face to face appointments, rather than over the phone, so it is important to keep these follow-up appointments. If you know you will be out of medication soon, please call UHCS at (617) 373-2772, option #2 well in advance of running out of medication to schedule an appointment. You will need to have an initial UHCS evaluation in order to be prescribed medications or have any prescriptions renewed. If you have ever had medication treatment in the past, it is important to bring prior documentation. This allows for your best possible care and can help ease the transition process. In addition to an initial evaluation appointment, treatment with stimulant prescriptions such as Ritalin, Adderall, or Concerta typically requires a neuropsychological evaluation and any information supporting an ADHD diagnosis including testing results.  Please note that UHCS clinicians generally do not consider benzodiazepines such as Xanax, Ativan, Valium and Klonopin to be first choices in treating anxiety due to the high potential for dependence."

Local STI Testing Sites,      
COST of STI Testing ,"STI testing is fully covered by most insurances but not all. NUSHP (Northeastern University Student Health Plan) fully covers the cost of STI testing and no bill is sent home (the testing is fully confidential). If you are unsure about your insurance coverage, please call your insurance company to verify potential costs. You can also request your insurance company mail any bill or explanation of benefits to your personal address (rather than your parents address). Insurance companies in the state of MA must comply with this request per the PATCH Act. An alternative option for confidential testing is to “Self Pay”. The cost of Gonorrhea and Chlamydia testing is $25 (per site tested; i.e. urine, pharyngeal, rectal). The cost of HIV and Syphilis testing are $25 each. If you Self Pay, SHOW YOUR RECEIPT TO THE BAYSTATE PHLEBOTOMIST; this ensures that Baystate knows not to bill your insurance. You can also seek testing at local clinics in Boston that offer free and confidential STI testing, such as MGH Sexual Health Clinic (617.726.2748)."
TREATMENT,"If you test positive for a sexually transmitted infection, please call UHCS to schedule an appointment to discuss treatment and management. Practice abstinence (no sex) until you are treated. Please notify sexual partners you have had within the past 60 days so that they can be tested and treated. You can let them know anonymously with TellYourPartner.org. If your partner does not have access to health insurance, you can book an appointment for yourself at UHCS and our providers can prescribe “Expedited Partner Therapy” for your partner in some cases. Condoms are an important part of decreasing exposure to sexually transmitted infections."
PrEP ,"If you are considering HIV Pre Exposure Prophylaxis, schedule an appointment at UHCS to discuss your options. PrEP is one pill, taken once a day, to decrease your chance of becoming infected with HIV. We will obtain baseline labs to check for HIV, other STI’s, and your kidney function. Your labs will result within a couple days and once reviewed by a clinician, you can start taking your PrEP medication. We will check in at one month to see how you are tolerating the medication. After that, you will have a visit at UHCS every three months to check labs and refill your prescription. NUSHP covers the cost of PrEP with no copay. For other For PrEP prescriptions online: Nurx, Mistr"
CONTRACEPTION,"Schedule an appointment to discuss all options for contraception. At UHCS, we prescribe emergency contraception, the birth control pill, patch, ring, gel, and shots. We refer to local Ob GYN clinics for insertion of IUDs and Nexplanons. Because of the Affordable Care Act, most insurance plans must cover one option of each birth control method with no copay. Your visit to discuss contraception can be via telehealth, but we do ask that you come on site before starting birth control to check your blood pressure and confirm you have a negative pregnancy test.Online options for a birth control prescription (ideal for students out of state): Nurx, Favor, Wisp, Lemonaid, Hers, Emme, Pandia HealthLocal ObGYN Clinics: Mass General Hospital, Brigham and Women’s, Beth Israel Deaconess, Tufts, Boston Medical Center, Saint Elizabeth’sFrisky Husky program delivers free external condoms, internal condoms, oral dams, and water-based lubricant right to your on-campus mailbox."

Smoking Cessation and RTQ,
 				What can I expect if I decide to participate in the Ready To Quit! program?			, 
 				What will my treatment plan include?			,"  Your treatment plan may include nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), such as nicotine patches and gum or lozenge, and/or medications, such as Chantix. More often than not, your clinician may combine two different cessation aids (i.e. two types of NRT) to help you stop smoking and stop smoking tobacco. Studies have shown this strategy is very effective in smoking cessation compared to using just one medication alone. It’s also important to use enough medication and long enough to manage your withdrawal symptoms, desires and urges to help you stop smoking for good. You and your clinician can determine which cessation aids are the best for you.  "
 				How much does it cost to participate in the Ready to Quit! program?			,  Smoking cessation aids are offered free of charge for students enrolled in RTQ.  
 				What supports will my TTS provide?			,"  Students enrolled in RTQ will have weekly follow-up and coaching meetings with a TTS. Students receive supportive, encouraging texts one to three times per week and receive follow-up phone calls at least once a week to provide support to remain tobacco-free. Students also have the option to meet with mental health for concerns regarding smoking cessation if desired.  "
 				Why should I quit smoking?			,  The American Lung Association has a great list of benefits on why quitting is a good idea.  
 				How do I get started?			,  Complete the online assessment form to get started.  
 				How can smoking cessation aids help?			,"  Cessation aids help decrease withdrawal symptoms (i.e. trouble sleeping, mood changes, and trouble concentrating, etc.) from nicotine that is found in tobacco products. Additionally, cessation aids help in reducing desires and urges to smoke and use tobacco. By decreasing withdrawal symptoms, reducing desires and urges allows you to focus on modifying behaviors that may be associated with smoking and tobacco use.  "
 				What are the different types of smoking cessation aids?			,"  Smoking cessation aids such as Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) (contains nicotine) and/or medications that do not contain nicotine may increase your chances of quitting tobacco successfully. To read more about the different types of NRT and medications, please view this PDF.  "
 				What makes smoking and tobacco use so harmful?			,"  When tobacco is burned, for example cigarette smoke, approximately 4,000 (i.e. cyanide, arsenic, lead, etc.) chemicals are released and inhaled into your body. Exposure to these chemicals has been shown to cause various types of cancer (i.e. mouth, throat, lungs, stomach, etc). Although nicotine alone, like that found in cigarettes, has not been shown to cause cancer, many other chemicals in tobacco products do. When you stop smoking or stop using other tobacco products, most chemicals leave your body quickly (hours, days, months), however many may remain for years. Read more about What’s in a Cigarette? by the American Lung Association.  "
 				What are the different types of tobacco products?			,"  Cigarettes, electronic cigarettes, cigars and cigarillos, chewing tobacco, hookahs, and spliffs are the most widely used tobacco products. View this PDF to learn more about these products and their impacts on health.  "
 				What are some other resources I can use to quit smoking?			,"  View this PDF for a list of additional resources, such as helplines, apps, and more.  "

No.  Massachusetts Department of Public Health requires that UHCS receive the health form and immunizations signed by your health care provider.    What should I do if I can’t access my immunization records?  You may have a blood test called antibody titer that shows whether you are already immune to measles, mumps, rubella, varicella, and Hepatitis B.

Please review with your clinician or contact UHCS with any questions 617-373-2772.     What will happen to me if I’m exposed to an infectious illness for which I am not appropriately vaccinated?
