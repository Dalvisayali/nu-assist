      "What happens when I am referred to ongoing in person counseling?\n",
      "If you and the Find@Northeastern clinician decide that a referral to ongoing, in person therapy is appropriate, the clinician will try to connect you by phone—in that moment—with a therapist in the local community. If the therapist you’re calling is available, you can speak with them directly and schedule an appointment for the coming days. If the therapist is not available at the time of the call, the Find clinician will help you leave a voicemail for the therapist to call you back and review scheduling options.\n",
      "Referrals for in person therapy are available for full-time students in the U.S. and some parts of Canada. Please contact UHCS or Find@Northeastern for more details.\n",
      "What happens when I am referred to ongoing telehealth?\n",
      "If you and the Find@Northeastern clinician decide that a referral to ongoing telehealth counseling is appropriate, the clinician will connect you via phone with a Find Navigator who will submit the referral. A counselor will then get in touch with you to schedule your first appointment. From your first appointment forward, you can connect with that therapist on video in real time. Telehealth is conducted by licensed clinicians via a secure videoconference platform called Zoom, which is similar to Skype.\n",
      "What if I am looking for specialized treatment?\n",
      "Through Find@Northeastern, all Northeastern students have unlimited free counseling sessions without using insurance. Find@Northeastern clinicians treat a range of issues, but they do not provide specialized care such as treatment for eating disorders, neuro-psychological testing, treatment for substance use or medication management.\n",
      "If you need to see a clinician who offers specialized care, Find@Northeastern will help locate an appropriate clinician who accepts your insurance.\n",
      "What if I want a counselor with specific demographics/identities or who speaks a language other than English?\n",
      "We make every effort to match you with a Find@Northeastern clinician who meets your demographic, identity, and language preferences; however, if one is not available through Find@Northeastern, we can initiate a referral through your insurance to find a clinician who meets your preferences.\n",
      "How much will face-to-face and video counseling cost?\n",
      "Full-time students enrolled in both the fall and spring semester, including N.U.In students, have access to unlimited free counseling. We make every effort possible to connect you with a therapist who will accept your insurance.\n",
      "Why might I be referred to treatment in the local community rather than connected with a clinician at UHCS?\n",
      "For students based in Boston, the clinicians at UHCS are here to offer brief assessment, follow-up visits and connection to ongoing care as needed. Clinicians in the community are generally able to provide longer-term treatment and more consistent and flexible scheduling, such as evening, Saturday, weekly, and telehealth (online) appointments.\n",
      "I saw a therapist through Find@Northeastern last year and used all of my available ten sessions. How do I reconnect with a therapist for unlimited free visits?\n",
      "As of fall 2021, Northeastern students are eligible for unlimited sessions through Find@Northeastern. If you are looking to reconnect with a therapist, call Find@Northeastern to discuss your current needs and to initiate a new referral. Let the Find clinician know if you are interested in reconnecting with the therapist you saw in the past. They will check to see if that therapist is currently available and if so, they will work to reconnect you with them. If that therapist is not currently available, they will assist you in connecting with another therapist.\n",
      "What is SilverCloud?\n",
      "If moments of anxiety or sadness sometimes stop you in your tracks, Find@Northeastern offers an online program to help you move past those feelings on your own and build resilience as you go.\n",

All services offered through UHCS, including calls to Find@Northeastern, are confidential. No information will be shared with anyone outside of UHCS without your consent. You may review more information about confidentiality and release of medical information\\xa0here. What happens when I am referred to ongoing in person counseling? If you and the Find@Northeastern clinician decide that a referral to ongoing, in person therapy is appropriate, the clinician will try to connect you by phone—in that moment—with a therapist in the local community. If the therapist you’re calling is available, you can speak with them directly and schedule an appointment for the coming days. If the therapist is not available at the time of the call, the Find clinician will help you leave a voicemail for the therapist to call you back and review scheduling options. Referrals for in person therapy are available for full-time students in the U.S. and some parts of Canada. Please contact\\xa0UHCS\\xa0or\\xa0Find@Northeastern\\xa0for more details. What happens when I am referred to ongoing telehealth? If you and the Find@Northeastern clinician decide that a referral to ongoing telehealth counseling is appropriate, the clinician will connect you via phone with a Find Navigator who will submit the referral. A counselor will then get in touch with you to schedule your first appointment. From your first appointment forward, you can connect with that therapist on video in real time.

UHCS works closely with both the\\xa0Massachusetts Department of Public Health and the Boston Public Health Commission to ensure that you have complied with this mandate. If UHCS does not receive your complete immunization record, you are at risk of being held out of classes and university activities.\\xa0    What immunizations are recommended? In addition to the required immunizations, University Health and Counseling Services recommends the following vaccinations: COVID-19 (series and boosters), HPV (3 dose series), Hepatitis A (2 dose series), Meningitis B, and Influenza. These immunizations are recommended but not required.   Can my parents confirm that I had the vaccines?   No.  Massachusetts Department of Public Health requires that UHCS receive the\\xa0health form and immunizations signed by your health care provider.    What should I do if I can’t access my immunization records?  You may have a blood test called antibody titer that shows whether you are already immune to measles, mumps, rubella, varicella, and Hepatitis B. You will need to get a tetanus/diphtheria/pertussis (Tdap) booster. This antibody titer tests can be done at your local health care provider office prior to arriving on campus. Titers may be drawn at UHCS – please see\\xa0fee schedule– for students already on campus.\\xa0   My doctor says I only need one measles immunization, is this true?  No.\\xa0\\xa0Massachusetts Department of Public Health, requires proof of two measles immunizations, both administered after January 1, 1968, at least one month apart, and after your first birthday.    Why do I need two mumps vaccines?   University Health and Counseling Services works with the Boston Public Health Commission and Massachusetts Department of Public Health. University requirements reflect the recommendations of both. Two doses of the mumps vaccine or a positive titer are required. The two mumps doses must be given at least 28 days apart, beginning at or after the first birthday.    What is the difference between the Td and the Tdap vaccines?   Tdap is a combination vaccine that includes tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis. Td is a booster vaccine for tetanus and diphtheria. Td does not protect against pertussis.\\xa0    In my country, rubella is not available, how can I get this vaccine?   UHCS provides\\xa0Shots and Immunizations\\xa0as well as titer testing. Students with Northeastern University Student Health Plan (NUSHP) are covered for all of their required vaccine costs. If you do not have NUSHP, vaccines may be purchased with a credit or debit card.\\xa0    How many shots are included in the hepatitis B immunization?   The hepatitis B immunization is comprised of 3 shots. The first shot can be given at any time, the second dose needs to be administered at least one month after the first. The third dose at least two months after the second and four months after the first.\\xa0     I had a meningitis vaccine 6 years ago, am I still covered?  No.  Northeastern University requires students to have the meningitis immunization within 5 years of the start of school.       Can I receive immunizations at UHCS?   Students are expected to be fully immunized prior to arriving on-campus.

If you do not have NUSHP, vaccines may be purchased with a credit or debit card.    The result of my blood titer was “equivocal” or “borderline”, what does this mean?   You may need another immunization to boost your immunity. Please review with your clinician or contact UHCS with any questions 617-373-2772.\\xa0    What will happen to me if I’m exposed to an infectious illness for which I am not appropriately vaccinated?   The\\xa0Boston Department of Public Health or Massachusetts Department of Public Health may determine that you have been exposed to an infectious illness and if you are not appropriately immunized, you may be\\xa0\\xa0required to be excluded from all University activities on campus including classes, academic work, residence halls, dining and social groups, for the specific time that encompasses your period of potential contagiousness.

      "Just Make One Call—or Visit UHCS If you need to see a clinician who offers specialized care, Find@Northeastern will help locate an appropriate clinician who accepts your insurance. What if I want a counselor with specific demographics/identities or who speaks a language other than English? We make every effort to match you with a Find@Northeastern clinician who meets your demographic, identity, and language preferences; however, if one is not available through Find@Northeastern, we can initiate a referral through your insurance to find a clinician who meets your preferences. How much will face-to-face and video counseling cost? Full-time students enrolled in both the fall and spring semester, including N.U.In students, have access to unlimited free counseling. We make every effort possible to connect you with a therapist who will accept your insurance. Why might I be referred to treatment in the local community rather than connected with a clinician at UHCS? For students based in Boston, the clinicians at UHCS are here to offer brief assessment, follow-up visits and connection to ongoing care as needed. Clinicians in the community are generally able to provide longer-term treatment and more consistent and flexible scheduling, such as evening, Saturday, weekly, and telehealth (online) appointments. I saw a therapist through Find@Northeastern last year and used all of my available ten sessions. How do I reconnect with a therapist for unlimited free visits? As of fall 2021, Northeastern students are eligible for unlimited sessions through Find@Northeastern. If you are looking to reconnect with a therapist, call Find@Northeastern to discuss your current needs and to initiate a new referral. Let the Find clinician know if you are interested in reconnecting with the therapist you saw in the past. They will check to see if that therapist is currently available and if so, they will work to reconnect you with them. If that therapist is not currently available, they will assist you in connecting with another therapist. What is SilverCloud? If moments of anxiety or sadness sometimes stop you in your tracks, Find@Northeastern offers an online program to help you move past those feelings on your own and build resilience as you go. SilverCloud, a digital on-demand mental health and well-being platform provides students with customized strategies to manage depression, anxiety, sleep issues, stress, resilience, and more.  Several sessions are available in both Spanish and English. You can choose to self-guide or work with a SilverCloud coach who will support you throughout the process.  It will help you build the tools and strategies that could improve your days – and your academic performance.  Go to https://student.silvercloudhealth.com/signup Select Northeastern University from the drop-down menu Create an account using your Northeastern email address You will receive a confirmation email from SilverCloud, you must respond in order to complete the log-in process  Can I access Find@Northeastern after I graduate? All full-time students graduating in May can access Find@Northeastern benefits, including the 24/7 support line and referrals for free visits, through the end of May. If you are looking for support options past May, we recommend you reach out to Find@Northeastern prior to May 31 to explore options available through your insurance. Full-time students graduating in August and December can access Find@Northeastern benefits through the last month of their final semester. If you are graduating during these months and looking for support options past graduation, we recommend you reach out to Find@Northeastern prior to August 31st for summer graduates and December 31st for fall graduates. I received a referral to a therapist through Find@Northeastern in the past but I did not connect with a clinician. I am interested in doing so now. How do I reconnect? Reach out to Find@Northeastern to initiate a new referral and discuss your current needs. How do I register for Headspace? Headspace is available for all full time students through Find@Northeastern.
