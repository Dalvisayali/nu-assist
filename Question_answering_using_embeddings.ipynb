    "- Recent events after Sep 2021\n",
    "- Your non-public documents\n",
    "- Information from past conversations\n",
    "- etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates a two-step Search-Ask method for enabling GPT to answer questions using a library of reference text.\n",

    "## Why search is better than fine-tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "GPT can learn knowledge in two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Via model weights (i.e., fine-tune the model on a training set)\n",
    "- Via model inputs (i.e., insert the knowledge into an input message)\n",
    "\n",
    "Although fine-tuning can feel like the more natural option—training on data is how GPT learned all of its other knowledge, after all—we generally do not recommend it as a way to teach the model knowledge. Fine-tuning is better suited to teaching specialized tasks or styles, and is less reliable for factual recall.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an analogy, model weights are like long-term memory. When you fine-tune a model, it's like studying for an exam a week away. When the exam arrives, the model may forget details, or misremember facts it never read.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, message inputs are like short-term memory. When you insert knowledge into a message, it's like taking an exam with open notes. With notes in hand, the model is more likely to arrive at correct answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "One downside of text search relative to fine-tuning is that each model is limited by a maximum amount of text it can read at once:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Model           | Maximum text length       |\n",
    "|-----------------|---------------------------|\n",
    "| `gpt-3.5-turbo` | 4,096 tokens (~5 pages)   |\n",
    "| `gpt-4`         | 8,192 tokens (~10 pages)  |\n",
    "| `gpt-4-32k`     | 32,768 tokens (~40 pages) |\n",
    "\n",
    "Continuing the analogy, you can think of the model like a student who can only look at a few pages of notes at a time, despite potentially having shelves of textbooks to draw upon.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, to build a system capable of drawing upon large quantities of text to answer questions, we recommend using a Search-Ask approach.\n"

    "## Search\n",
    "\n",
    "Text can be searched in many ways. E.g.,\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lexical-based search\n",
    "- Graph-based search\n",
    "- Embedding-based search\n",
    "\n",
    "This example notebook uses embedding-based search. [Embeddings](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings) are simple to implement and work especially well with questions, as questions often don't lexically overlap with their answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider embeddings-only search as a starting point for your own system. Better search systems might combine multiple search methods, along with features like popularity, recency, user history, redundancy with prior search results, click rate data, etc. Q&A retrieval performance may also be improved with techniques like [HyDE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10496), in which questions are first transformed into hypothetical answers before being embedded. Similarly, GPT can also potentially improve search results by automatically transforming questions into sets of keywords or search terms."

    "## Full procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, this notebook demonstrates the following procedure:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Prepare search data (once per document)\n",
    "    1. Collect: We'll download a few hundred Wikipedia articles about the 2022 Olympics\n",
    "    2. Chunk: Documents are split into short, mostly self-contained sections to be embedded\n",
    "    3. Embed: Each section is embedded with the OpenAI API\n",
    "    4. Store: Embeddings are saved (for large datasets, use a vector database)\n",
    "2. Search (once per query)\n",
    "    1. Given a user question, generate an embedding for the query from the OpenAI API\n",
    "    2. Using the embeddings, rank the text sections by relevance to the query\n",
    "3. Ask (once per query)\n",
    "    1. Insert the question and the most relevant sections into a message to GPT\n",
    "    2. Return GPT's answer\n",
    "\n",
    "### Costs\n",
    "\n",
    "Because GPT is more expensive than embeddings search, a system with a decent volume of queries will have its costs dominated by step 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For `gpt-3.5-turbo` using ~1,000 tokens per query, it costs ~$0.002 per query, or ~500 queries per dollar (as of Apr 2023)\n",
    "- For `gpt-4`, again assuming ~1,000 tokens per query, it costs ~$0.03 per query, or ~30 queries per dollar (as of Apr 2023)\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, exact costs will depend on the system specifics and usage patterns."

Confidentiality: All services offered through Find@Northeastern are confidential, and no information will be shared without the student's consent.\\n\\n2. Unlimited free counseling sessions: Northeastern students have access to unlimited free counseling sessions through Find@Northeastern. These sessions do not require the use of insurance.\\n\\n3. Specialized treatment: While Find@Northeastern clinicians treat a range of issues, they do not provide specialized care for eating disorders, neuro-psychological testing, substance use treatment, or medication management.\\n\\n4. 24/7 support: Find@Northeastern provides 24/7 support for students. Students can call the support line at +1.877.233.9477 (U.S.), 855.229.8797 (Canada), or +1.781.457.7777 (International) to speak with a licensed mental health counselor who will listen, offer guidance, and help create a plan.\\n\\n5. Access after graduation: Full-time students graduating in May can continue to access Find@Northeastern benefits, including the 24/7 support line and referrals for free visits, through the end of May. For support options beyond May, students are advised to reach out to Find@Northeastern prior to May 31 to explore options available through their insurance.\\n\\n6. International access: Students residing outside of the United States can access Find@Northeastern through international phone numbers or by using the provided link and website for contact initiation.\\n\\n7. Referrals and matching preferences: Find@Northeastern makes efforts to match students with clinicians who meet their demographic, identity, and language preferences. If a suitable match is not available, a referral can be initiated through the student's insurance.\\n\\n8. Video counseling: Find@Northeastern offers licensed video counselors for students to connect with for support, providing flexibility and accessibility.\\n\\n9. SilverCloud: Find@Northeastern offers an online program called SilverCloud, which helps students manage feelings of anxiety, sadness, and build resilience through self-guided interactive resources.\\n\\n10. Cost and insurance: Full-time students enrolled in both the fall and spring semesters, including N.U.In students, have access to unlimited free counseling. Efforts are made to connect students with therapists who accept their insurance.\\n\\n11. Local community treatment: In some cases, students may be referred to treatment in the local community instead of being connected with a clinician at UHCS (University Health and Counseling Services). Community clinicians can provide longer-term treatment and more flexible scheduling options.\\n\\nThese articles provide information about the services, confidentiality, access, and support available through Find@Northeastern.\""
